        The only help you\'ll ever need and never read.<br><br><br>


        1. What is newsletter.h?<br><br>

        It\'s a newsletter released by the awesome CSE Dept. of SRM University, Vadapalani.<br><br><br>


        2. How do I navigate in this app?<br><br>

        WOW. How did you get this far through Android? Anyway, jokes aside, swipe from the left to open the navigation drawer.<br><br><br>


        3. What are the different items in the navigation drawer? What do they do?<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Latest issue - Our latest issue served up hot.</li>
            <li>Archive - Our cold and outdated issues.</li>
            <li>Favorites - Our articles that you liked.</li>
            <li>Statistics - Some random geeky data.</li>
        </ul><br><br><br>


        4. Do you collect my personal data?<br><br>

        Why would I? I track your usage patters in this app through Google Analytics. Helps me fix bugs. I am not collecting your personal data.
        Neither am I collecting any information about which articles you read and the ones you liked. You can disable Google Analytics by going
        over to Settings and then un-checking the box that says "Google Analytics".<br><br><br>


        5. Is this app open-source?<br><br>

        Yes. Head over to the About section to learn more.<br><br><br>


        6. How does this app work?<br><br>

        Android terms coming at you. Hold tight. The app I would say is quite future proof. It\'s not just a simple request to the database and fetching
        stuff from it and displaying it to you. The app makes a request to the database using Retrofit. The databases returns the articles in the form
        of JSON. Thanks to Google\'s GSON library the JSON parsing is made super easy. All queries to the database are an AsyncTask. The app secretly
        maintains an SQLite internal database. Whatever data it fetches, it stores in this internal database, making the application load data very fast
        after the data is fetched for the first time. Tha app also uses a Content Provider and Cursor Loaders. This allows the app to be really snazzy about
        how data is handled and has the benefit of continuously listening for changes in data. Not simple to code, but effective.<br><br><br>


        7. Who developed this app?<br><br>

        How do I know?<br><br><br>


        8. How long did this app take to make?<br><br>

        Development on this app started way before mobile phones came into existence which happened approximately 90 years back if my math is right.<br><br><br>
